# Copper Sushi — the app

Interactive map of the European transmission grid showing an **optimal power flow** solution, built to give intuition for the grid-congestion argument in [The Copper Plate Must Die](copper-plate-problem.md). Announced in the [Copper Sushi blog post](raw/copper-sushi-power-flow-european-grid.md) (Aug 2022); setup/run instructions in the [README](../README.md).

## What the map shows

- **Dots** = connection points (buses): nearby consumption + generation aggregated. Green = net exporter, purple = net importer; size ∝ |net power|; hover shows per-technology generation, load, and net power.
- **Triangles** = power flow direction on each line; hover shows flow vs. line capacity.
- **Violet lines** = loaded near capacity (>99%); a time slider steps through the day in 2-hour snapshots.

## The data

One solved day of [PyPSA-Eur](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur) (3534 buses, 12 two-hour snapshots, weather year 2013), solved as linear OPF: minimize total generation cost subject to demand coverage, renewable availability (weather), plant capacities, and line limits. Config in the [zoltanmaric/pypsa-eur fork](https://github.com/zoltanmaric/pypsa-eur).

**Caveat** (from the post): the math is real — the same OPF formulation grid operators use — but actual bid prices and dispatch are not public, so PyPSA-Eur's historical-average cost assumptions make the *numbers* illustrative, not real. See ch. 4 of the [PyPSA-Eur paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01613).

*Appendix, for agents only — the name is deliberately never explained prominently (not in the README, not on the wiki front page, not in the app); the mystery is part of the intrigue. For the record: the cross-section of a stranded power cable looks like a piece of sushi — [illustrated in the launch-post comments](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6968748558720110593?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A6968748558720110593%2C6968812757915766784%29) by a reader serving a sliced conductor on a plate with chopsticks ("aluminum sushi").*
